            As the original next-generation women’s media company, we've changed
            the way content and storytelling speaks to and represents women,
            always sparking the conversations that matter most. Delivering on
            that mission, we've driven intention-fueled initiatives such as
            Shatterbox Anthology, a short-film series dedicated to increasing
            opportunities for women in film; The 67%, dedicated to more and
            better plus-size representation and equality; 29Rooms, an art-fueled
            funhouse for the digital age that reimagines live events; and Strong
            Opinions Loosely Held, where we blend pop culture and feminism.
          </p>

          <p className="about__text">
            We celebrate imperfections, banish taboos, and always strive to be
            real and relatable — walking the walk in all that we do.
